# Elektro repair Mortsel

Website built for my dad's business, using AstroJS

- first time working with Tailwind, combined with custom SCSS
- tight schedule so code is definitly not bug free
- first experience with Figma to create the website's UI

To make it work:
- run `npm install`
- adjust the .env.example file in the /public/php folder and install all composer dependencies by running `composer.phar install` in that same directory

Deployed at Netlify: https://vermillion-griffin-133731.netlify.app/ (mail form doesn't there because PHP is not supported by Netlify)
