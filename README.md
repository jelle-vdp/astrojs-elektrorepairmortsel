# Elektro repair Mortsel

Website built for my dad's business, using AstroJS

- first time working with Tailwind, combined with custom SCSS
- tight schedule so code is definitly not bug free
- first experience with Figma to create the website's UI

Adjust the .env.example file in the /public/php folder and install all composer dependencies in that same directory to make it work.
